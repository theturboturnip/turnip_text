//! The combinatorial explosion of moving between block/inline states hsa gotten too much to handle.
//! It's also inconvenient - e.g. `[thing]{contents}` may only emit an Inline, even if it's the only thing on the line and looks like it could emit Block, because the parser moves to "inline mode" and can't handle getting a Block out of that.
//! The correct course of action would be for the code processor to compute the inner inline, pass it into the processor, realize it got a Block out, and emit that block directly.
//! I'm envisioning a system with a stack of processors: every time a new token is received it's given to the topmost processor on the stack, which can return
//! - an error, stopping everything
//! - a completed object, implicitly popping the stack of processors
//! - a new processor to push to the stack
//!
//! If a completed object is returned, the processor is popped and the object is passed into the next processor on the stack to be integrated into the contents.
//! This method is convenient because it handles other alt-states for parsing such as comments and raw strings naturally by putting them on top of the stack!
//!
//! Each file has a separate [FileProcessorstack], which falls back to the topmost processor in the previous file or the topmost processor of the whole document if no containing files have processors.
//! It's possible to have a tall stack of files where no file is using a processor - e.g. if you have file A include
//! file B include file C include file D, and you just write paragraphs, files A through C will have empty processor stacks while file D is being processed and paragraphs from file D will bubble right up to the top-level document.
//!
//! This processor structure introduces strict newline separation for blocks:
//! - after eval-bracket-emitting-block-or-header-or-inserted-file-or-none, a blank line must be seen before any content
//! - after closing a block-level block scope (i.e. ignoring block scopes used as arguments to code producing inline), a blank line must be seen before any content
//! There's no need to worry about this with paragraphs (double newline required to end the paragraph) and block scope opens/closes (extra newlines between opening new block scopes seems superfluous, opening a block scope requires a newline, block scopes can't be closed mid paragraph)
//! This means newlines must bubble up through files (blocks inside an inner file are governed by either the top-level document token processor or an enclosing block scope processor, both of which are "the next file up"), and I previously worried that this would mean newlines in an inner file would affect an outer file.
//! Not so!
//! Note that the first condition requires that after eval-bracket-emitting-inserted-file, a newline must be seen before any content.
//! The newline-consuming state of the outer processor is always reset when an inserted file is opened and after an inserted file is closed, so inserted files can't have an inconsistent impact on enclosing files and vice versa.
//!
//! TODO update documentation
