This library is intended to provide a consistent method for reducing bibliographies to the minimal required set for a given document (My_Whole_Library.bib -> This_Article.bib)

Later, it might be used as a metadata hub (e.g. \citeauthor equivalent in LaTeX?)
Other possible features:
Automatic sanitization? e.g. if DOI and URL choose DOI?
Automatic nice sorting?
